# Numerical Analysis

We used `python` in order to simplyfy the coding part and really focus on the `Numerical Analysis` in details
This repository contains the template codes for the following
## Solving Nonlinear Equations
- Bisection Method
- Newton-Raphson Method

## System of Linear Equations
- Gaussian Elimination

## Interpolation
- Newton’s Divided Difference Interpolation
- Lagrangian Interpolation

## Integration
- Using Trapezoidal Rule
- Using Simpson’s 1/3rd Rule

## Regression
- Linear Regression
- Nonlinear Regression

And some basic OOP in python
